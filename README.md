Lenient Shutdown plugin
=======================

This plugin lets you put Jenkins in shutdown mode but still allow any downstream builds of those currently running to also complete.
Similar functionality for taking nodes temporarily offline.


## Building

### One-time set-up: using mise-en-place

If you have the [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) tool manager installed, you can perform these one-time steps:
1. Trust this repository via `mise trust`
2. Install the tools via `mise install`
3. Confirm it's working via `mvn --version`

### One-time set-up: manually

1. Install the version of OpenJDK called out by the `.java-version` file.
2. Install the version of Maven called out by the `maven` key in the `mise.toml` file.
3. Confirm it's working via `mvn --version`

### Compile and test

Most of the time, you'll want to invoke:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

This should compile the code and the test code, then run the tests.


### Other interesting targets

Aside from `clean` and `test` demonstrated above, here are other targets you can give Maven:

| Target            | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `javadoc:javadoc` | Parses the JavaDoc comments and generates the `target/site/apidocs` directory    |
| `hpi:hpi`         | Creates the `target/lenientshutdown.hpi` file, for testing the plugin in Jenkins |
